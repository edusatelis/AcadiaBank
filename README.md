# AcadiaBank
I generate this project with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.10 to demonstrate my frontend skills. I create a single page for a fictional bank in which I named Acadia Bank to honor[4cadia Factory](https://4cadia.com/), where I intend to guarantee a job vacancy.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
